# Neural-Machine-Translation
A simple Neural Machine Translation(NMT) system. You will build a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model. You will start with a basic encoderdecoder model with RNN cells. Then, you will improve it by adding an attention mechanism to make the model better at focusing on the important words in each sentence
